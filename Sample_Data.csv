If you want to completely get rid of some chronic ailments right from the root of it then Homeopathy is the best. And always remember the better a patient explains his/her symptoms and gives feedback about the ailment/problem to the doctor the faster results are achieved with medicines.  Itâ€™s a big myth that Homeopathy medicine takes time to heal, I can vouch for that as I have seen some phenomenal results during my experience of seeking this treatment as and when needed for all age groups within my family, from new borns to toddlers, school going kids to adults and even the elderly.  The Aroraâ€™s carry a legacy of rich experience of Homeopathy Medicine with them running into generations, who have been handling patients from a wide spectrum for almost 60 years or more cumulatively amongst them. And trust you me this experience plays a pivotal role in their successful journey of serving the mankind through Homeopathy.  I am sure that like me and my family there would thousands of other individuals who have been seeking successful cure from Dr. Aroraâ€™s Homeopathy clinic, we will always extend our good wishes and gratitude towards them.

Thanks for saving my tooth, Dr. Sudhir Sharma.  3 years ago, I got a Root Canal Treatment (RCT) from an overseas dentist. I work in another country. I paid 40,000 Rupees for the RCT and 50,000 Rupees for the crown tooth to cover it. One year later, the crown broke, and unfortunately, I was traveling to Russia at that time. It devastated me, being in a country where I don't speak the language, I don't live there, I don't even know how to find a dentist. Days later, bearing this excruciating pain, I managed to get an appointment with a dentist in Russia. The dentist told me there is an 80% chance that I will lose my tooth and have to go for an implant; this also means spending almost 1 lakh rupees as Russia's procedure is quite expensive.  It was the same time when COVID-19 started spreading around the world. Instead of going back to the country where I work, I headed home to stay with my family in those unprecedented times.  My brother recommended â€œDental De Careâ€\x9d to me. Dr. Sudhir Sharma took my case, and the first thing he did is reassure me he will save my tooth. In the first procedure, he helped me get rid of the pain. I can't thank him enough. Later, when faced with a specific procedure dilemma, he immediately consulted with Dr. Nimisha Singh, an expert in dental surgeries. What sets Dental De Care apart from most dentists I visited is explaining every step of the procedure in laymen's terms. This really helped me to ease out.  The RCT cost me less than 5000 rupees. You can't imagine how happy I was to know this.  Anyway, I waited almost 10 months to write this review because I wanted to be sure that my newly placed crown is intact.  I highly recommend Dental De Care.

My experience in simple words:- (This review is only about maternity services in this hospital) 1. Dr. Renu Makkar :- experienced, jovial nature, encourages her patients, very cooperative, but remember she is highly professional, probability of you/your wife ending up having a C-section is very high. And my personal complaint- she didn't give any concession on the final bill ðŸ˜Š. 2. Hospital facilities:- Just average compared to the hefty amount charged. Rooms are fine,toilet cleanliness not up to the mark, TV in the room not working (when my wife was admitted), old and dirty refrigerator in the room. 3. Nursing Staff:- Old & experienced nurses but they are overburdened so they hurry things up. Secondly, you will be forced to pay a heavy amount as tip after the birth of your child. But they are very helpful. 4. Cleanliness staff:- Staff is less, so on duty staff is overburdened but they still work hard, however, cleanliness inside the room and toilet is not good. 5. Other facilities:- There is a canteen in the basement which opens after 10 AM, it's useless. No parking is available for four wheelers, so you end up struggling to park your vehicle in the small space available."", 'Very Good doctor in Lucknow for infertility treatment.', 'Makkar multi speciality hospital...Good hospital in laxmi nagar....Dr ashish makkar is very good doctor ....I am happy in this hospital.....', 'I visited at her centre first time.  they charged consultation fee 500/- and after that 500/-for counseling.no counseling done,only dr.consultation was done.dr.was good but why they charged 500/- extra for counselling.when I asked at the reception then they said that first time Lagta hai agli bar Nahi lagega.so aware of this nonsense', 'Be ðŸ˜\x8dh     e', 'Good hospital .........

He is a shame on the name of doctors. My father went to him for a digestion related issue. The doctor gave him a bunch of liquid medicines. They were so strong that even if  a drop of it spilled on a clothe, it literally made a hole in the clothe. Imagine what it would have done to my fatherâ€™s body! It was like drinking acid. Dad did go back to him mentioning that the medication wasnâ€™t suiting him. The GREAT doctor gave him some more liquid medicine on top of the medicines which were not suiting him.  Three months of continuous medication has taken a major toll on my fatherâ€™s body and he is literally bed ridden now.

I had very very bad experience there. Doctor's behavior is super rude. He thinks that he is doing a favor to his patients by taking money from them.

I went to see him for my mother's diabetes and hypertension, just for a routine visit on someone's referral. My mother told him that she doesn't have any issues except that she has slight pain in her knees. He told her that there is no need to visit an orthopedic surgeon and he will cure it. He prescribed some stupid multivitamins and 2 painkillers for one month, the medicines costing around 4k - 5k. After completing the course her condition has drastically worsened. The only reason her pain was not that bad for one month was because of the painkillers. After the medicines stopped, her condition got real bad. Only God knows what was inside those tablets and capsules. Any lateral movement in her knees and she starts crying in pain. All the medicines he wrote except the painkillers were available at his pharmacy only. I am afraid he prescribes low quality medicines for large margins of profit. And they will always avoid giving printed receipts for the medicines you buy, always making excuses like printer is not working or printer is out of ink or paper. You won't find the medicines he prescribes at any other pharmacy except his own. Every time I have to go 5 kms just to buy my mother's medicines.   Sometimes the pharmacy is closed and you have to go next day. This has been going on for months. You won't even find the brand names of medicines he prescribes on Google.
